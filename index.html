        <h1>About Me</h1>

        <img src="assets/images/selfie.jpg" alt="me" id="selfie" />

        <p>I was born on November 20, 1990 in San Salvador, El Salvador. My family moved to the United States
            because of our country's civil war. I was seven years old when I first arrived. I consider the USA my home
            and have come to love living here.
        </p>

        <p>I received an Associate's Degree in Engineering Science from Wilbur Wright College in 2011. I co-owned a
            small business for over 4 years specializing in repairing consumer electronics such as smartphones,
            computers and tablets. Now I am on a new career search which is why I enrolled in this coding bootcamp.
        </p>

        <p>During my free time, I like to ride my motorcycle, play basketball with my nephew, skateboard and fiddle
            with electronics. I also love traveling and attending concerts!
